There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","Steps to resolve this issue include :

- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer

When performing DBX updates exactly as illustrated in the vendor documentation, it is crucial to consider that if you apply solely the most recent update, the updates will be appended exclusively to the DBX database.
Therefore, it might still be necessary to apply the older updates from the ""Archive of Prior Versions of DBX Files,"" which can be found in the UEFI Revocation List File document.

Apply the DBX update with the updated signatures from March 2, 2021 or later.

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target

successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","Steps to resolve this issue include :

- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer

    support or does not recognize.

    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","

It is, therefore,
affected by a remote code execution vulnerability. Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security
fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack where an attacker with permission
to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data
source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute remote code. This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to
the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2. 

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.","Upgrade to Apache Log4j version 2.17.1, 2.12.4, or 2.3.2 or later, or apply the vendor mitigation.

remote target and Nessus did not log any subsequent errors or failures
for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise
valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in
incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues
that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used
for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular
check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the
protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and
intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a
credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This
plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during
the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See
plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the
  remote target may have consistently succeeded with no
  privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB
  service on the remote target may have failed
  intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication
  protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of
  resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary
  from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is
  gathered from the target via that protocol and what
  particular check failed. For example, consistently
  successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux
  targets than for Windows targets, and likewise
  consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical
  for Windows targets than for Linux targets.","n/a","","

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target

successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","

longer supported. Log4j reached its end of life prior to 2016. Additionally, Log4j 1.x is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities, including :

  - Log4j includes a SocketServer that accepts serialized log events and deserializes them without verifying whether
    the objects are allowed or not. This can provide an attack vector that can be exploited. (CVE-2019-17571)

  - Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in Apache Log4j SMTP appender. This could allow an SMTPS
    connection to be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log messages sent through that
    appender. (CVE-2020-9488)

  - JMSSink uses JNDI in an unprotected manner allowing any application using the JMSSink to be vulnerable if it is
    configured to reference an untrusted site or if the site referenced can be accesseed by the attacker.

    an invalid field and return error. Unfortunately, when doing so it also invokes `free()` on a 4 byte
    localstack buffer. Most modern malloc implementations detect this error and immediately abort. Some
    however accept the input pointer and add that memory to its list of available chunks. This leads to the
    overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the `free()`
    implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags. The most likely outcome of exploting this
    flaw is a crash, although it cannot be ruled out that more serious results can be had in special
    circumstances. (CVE-2024-6197)

  - An unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted protocol message to a Routing and Remote 
    Access Service (RRAS) server, which could lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the RAS server machine.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","

It is, therefore, affected by a key 
recovery attack vulnerability. In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker 
to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially 
important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. The required set of 
signed messages may be publicly readable because they are stored in a public Git service that supports use of SSH for 
commit signing, and the signatures were made by Pageant through an agent-forwarding mechanism. In other words, an 
adversary may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's private key, even if there is no 
further use of vulnerable PuTTY versions. After a key compromise, an adversary may be able to conduct supply-chain 
attacks on software maintained in Git. A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH 
server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted 
by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other 
entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can 
derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the other services 
include Git services, then again it may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. 
This also affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3, TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and 
TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.
