occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

successful because the authentication protocol service was available

protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB

    in the 4.0.x series or lower and releases in the 4.3.x series) are beyond their End-of-Life (EOL) and no
    longer supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from
    those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering
    the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected
    (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler
    flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced
    the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when
    reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to
    the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd
    server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to
    the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in
    lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in
    the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit
    architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not
    occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be
    improperly deleted. (CVE-2021-25217)

  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap
    buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other
    malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But
    there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.
    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the
    octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence
    of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote
    exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing
    modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,
    `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to
    directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module
    `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present
    on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be
    specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important
    modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)

  - A heap out-of-bounds write may heppen during the handling of Huffman tables in the PNG reader. This may
    lead to data corruption in the heap space. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availablity impact may be
    considered Low as it's very complex to an attacker control the encoding and positioning of corrupted
    Huffman entries to achieve results such as arbitrary code execution and/or secure boot circumvention. This
    flaw affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3696)

  - A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write in the heap area. An attacker may
    take advantage of that to cause heap data corruption or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent
    secure boot protections. This issue has a high complexity to be exploited as an attacker needs to perform
    some triage over the heap layout to achieve signifcant results, also the values written into the memory
    are repeated three times in a row making difficult to produce valid payloads. This flaw affects grub2
    versions prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3695)

  - A crafted JPEG image may lead the JPEG reader to underflow its data pointer, allowing user-controlled data
    to be written in heap. To a successful to be performed the attacker needs to perform some triage over the
    heap layout and craft an image with a malicious format and payload. This vulnerability can lead to data
    corruption and eventual code execution or secure boot circumvention. This flaw affects grub2 versions
    prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3697)

  - Integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets; A malicious crafted IP packet can lead to an integer
    underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets() function on rsm->total_len value. Under certain circumstances the
    total_len value may end up wrapping around to a small integer number which will be used in memory

  - In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-

  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.
    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME
    incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently
    interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL
    checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may
    allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
    enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate
    chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these
    inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is
    uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented
    their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. (CVE-2023-0286)

    Although eu-size is intended to support ar files inside ar files, handle_ar in size.c closes the outer ar
    file before handling all inner entries. The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service
    (application crash) with a crafted ELF file. (CVE-2018-18520)

  - In elfutils 0.175, a heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in the function elf32_xlatetom in
    elf32_xlatetom.c in libelf. A crafted ELF input can cause a segmentation fault leading to denial of
    service (program crash) because ebl_core_note does not reject malformed core file notes. (CVE-2019-7665)

  - An invalid memory address dereference was discovered in dwfl_segment_report_module.c in libdwfl in
    elfutils through v0.174. The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) with a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated by consider_notes. (CVE-2018-18310)

  - Divide-by-zero vulnerabilities in the function arlib_add_symbols() in arlib.c in elfutils 0.174 allow
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) with a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated
    by eu-ranlib, because a zero sh_entsize is mishandled. (CVE-2018-18521)

  - A heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in the function read_srclines in dwarf_getsrclines.c in libdw
    in elfutils 0.175. A crafted input can cause segmentation faults, leading to denial-of-service, as
    demonstrated by eu-nm. (CVE-2019-7149)

  - An issue was discovered in elfutils 0.175. A segmentation fault can occur in the function elf64_xlatetom
    in libelf/elf32_xlatetom.c, due to dwfl_segment_report_module not checking whether the dyn data read from
    a core file is truncated. A crafted input can cause a program crash, leading to denial-of-service, as
    demonstrated by eu-stack. (CVE-2019-7150)

  - In elfutils 0.175, a negative-sized memcpy is attempted in elf_cvt_note in libelf/note_xlate.h because of
    an incorrect overflow check. Crafted elf input causes a segmentation fault, leading to denial of service
    (program crash). (CVE-2019-7664)

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target

successful because the authentication protocol service was available

protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","

  - In ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16, ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.2 (Other branches of ISC DHCP (i.e., releases
    in the 4.0.x series or lower and releases in the 4.3.x series) are beyond their End-of-Life (EOL) and no
    longer supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from
    those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering
    the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected
    (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler
    flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced
    the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when
    reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to
    the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd
    server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to
    the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in
    lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in
    the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit
    architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not
    occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be
    improperly deleted. (CVE-2021-25217)

  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap
    buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other
    malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But
    there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.
    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the
    octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence
    of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote
    exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing
    modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,
    `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to
    directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module
    `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present
    on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be
    specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important
    modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)

  - A heap out-of-bounds write may heppen during the handling of Huffman tables in the PNG reader. This may
    lead to data corruption in the heap space. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availablity impact may be
    considered Low as it's very complex to an attacker control the encoding and positioning of corrupted
    Huffman entries to achieve results such as arbitrary code execution and/or secure boot circumvention. This
    flaw affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3696)

  - A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write in the heap area. An attacker may
    take advantage of that to cause heap data corruption or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent
    secure boot protections. This issue has a high complexity to be exploited as an attacker needs to perform
    some triage over the heap layout to achieve signifcant results, also the values written into the memory
    are repeated three times in a row making difficult to produce valid payloads. This flaw affects grub2
    versions prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3695)

  - A crafted JPEG image may lead the JPEG reader to underflow its data pointer, allowing user-controlled data
    to be written in heap. To a successful to be performed the attacker needs to perform some triage over the
    heap layout and craft an image with a malicious format and payload. This vulnerability can lead to data
    corruption and eventual code execution or secure boot circumvention. This flaw affects grub2 versions
    prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3697)

  - Integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets; A malicious crafted IP packet can lead to an integer
    underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets() function on rsm->total_len value. Under certain circumstances the
    total_len value may end up wrapping around to a small integer number which will be used in memory
    allocation. If the attack succeeds in such way, subsequent operations can write past the end of the
    buffer. (CVE-2022-28733)

  - Out-of-bounds write when handling split HTTP headers; When handling split HTTP headers, GRUB2 HTTP code
    accidentally moves its internal data buffer point by one position. This can lead to a out-of-bound write
    further when parsing the HTTP request, writing a NULL byte past the buffer. It's conceivable that an
    attacker controlled set of packets can lead to corruption of the GRUB2's internal memory metadata.

  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.
    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME
    incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently
    interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL
    checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may
    allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
    enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate
    chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these
    inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is
    uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented
    their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. (CVE-2023-0286)

  - dwarf_getaranges in dwarf_getaranges.c in libdw in elfutils before 2018-08-18 allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read) via a crafted file. (CVE-2018-16062)

  - libelf/elf_end.c in elfutils 0.173 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (double free and
    application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact because it tries to decompress twice.
    (CVE-2018-16402)

  - libdw in elfutils 0.173 checks the end of the attributes list incorrectly in dwarf_getabbrev in
    dwarf_getabbrev.c and dwarf_hasattr in dwarf_hasattr.c, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and an
    application crash. (CVE-2018-16403)

  - An Invalid Memory Address Dereference exists in the function elf_end in libelf in elfutils through v0.174.
    Although eu-size is intended to support ar files inside ar files, handle_ar in size.c closes the outer ar
    file before handling all inner entries. The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service
    (application crash) with a crafted ELF file. (CVE-2018-18520)

  - In elfutils 0.175, a heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in the function elf32_xlatetom in
    elf32_xlatetom.c in libelf. A crafted ELF input can cause a segmentation fault leading to denial of
    service (program crash) because ebl_core_note does not reject malformed core file notes. (CVE-2019-7665)

  - An invalid memory address dereference was discovered in dwfl_segment_report_module.c in libdwfl in
    elfutils through v0.174. The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) with a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated by consider_notes. (CVE-2018-18310)

  - Divide-by-zero vulnerabilities in the function arlib_add_symbols() in arlib.c in elfutils 0.174 allow
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) with a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated
    by eu-ranlib, because a zero sh_entsize is mishandled. (CVE-2018-18521)

  - A heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in the function read_srclines in dwarf_getsrclines.c in libdw
    in elfutils 0.175. A crafted input can cause segmentation faults, leading to denial-of-service, as
    demonstrated by eu-nm. (CVE-2019-7149)

  - An issue was discovered in elfutils 0.175. A segmentation fault can occur in the function elf64_xlatetom
    in libelf/elf32_xlatetom.c, due to dwfl_segment_report_module not checking whether the dyn data read from
    a core file is truncated. A crafted input can cause a program crash, leading to denial-of-service, as
    demonstrated by eu-stack. (CVE-2019-7150)

  - In elfutils 0.175, a negative-sized memcpy is attempted in elf_cvt_note in libelf/note_xlate.h because of
    an incorrect overflow check. Crafted elf input causes a segmentation fault, leading to denial of service
    (program crash). (CVE-2019-7664)
