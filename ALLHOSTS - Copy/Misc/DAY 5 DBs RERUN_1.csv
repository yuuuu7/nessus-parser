an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available

  - dbus before 1.10.28, 1.12.x before 1.12.16, and 1.13.x before 1.13.12, as used in DBusServer in Canonical
    Upstart in Ubuntu 14.04 (and in some, less common, uses of dbus-daemon), allows cookie spoofing because of
    symlink mishandling in the reference implementation of DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 in the libdbus library. (This only
    affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism.) A malicious client with write access to its own
    home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to
    read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case, this could result in the DBusServer reusing a
    cookie that is known to the malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent
    client connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication bypass. (CVE-2019-12749)

    the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected
    (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler
    flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced
    the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when
    reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to
    the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd
    server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to
    the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in
    lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in
    the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit

1)  A plugin tried to access a resource that requires a special

  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap
    buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other
    malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But
    there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.
    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the
    octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence
    of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote
    exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing
    modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,
    `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to
    directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module
    `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present
    on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be
    specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important
    modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)

  - A heap out-of-bounds write may heppen during the handling of Huffman tables in the PNG reader. This may
    lead to data corruption in the heap space. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availablity impact may be
    considered Low as it's very complex to an attacker control the encoding and positioning of corrupted
    Huffman entries to achieve results such as arbitrary code execution and/or secure boot circumvention. This
    flaw affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3696)

  - A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write in the heap area. An attacker may
    take advantage of that to cause heap data corruption or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent
    secure boot protections. This issue has a high complexity to be exploited as an attacker needs to perform
    some triage over the heap layout to achieve signifcant results, also the values written into the memory
    are repeated three times in a row making difficult to produce valid payloads. This flaw affects grub2
    versions prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3695)

  - A crafted JPEG image may lead the JPEG reader to underflow its data pointer, allowing user-controlled data
    to be written in heap. To a successful to be performed the attacker needs to perform some triage over the
    heap layout and craft an image with a malicious format and payload. This vulnerability can lead to data
    corruption and eventual code execution or secure boot circumvention. This flaw affects grub2 versions
    prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3697)

  - Integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets; A malicious crafted IP packet can lead to an integer
    underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets() function on rsm->total_len value. Under certain circumstances the
    total_len value may end up wrapping around to a small integer number which will be used in memory
    allocation. If the attack succeeds in such way, subsequent operations can write past the end of the
    buffer. (CVE-2022-28733)

  - Out-of-bounds write when handling split HTTP headers; When handling split HTTP headers, GRUB2 HTTP code
    accidentally moves its internal data buffer point by one position. This can lead to a out-of-bound write
    further when parsing the HTTP request, writing a NULL byte past the buffer. It's conceivable that an
    attacker controlled set of packets can lead to corruption of the GRUB2's internal memory metadata.

  - In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-
    provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append
    arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. Affected
    versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain a

  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.
    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME
    incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently
    interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL
    checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may
    allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
    enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate
    chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these
    inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is
    uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented
    their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. (CVE-2023-0286)

  - An issue was discovered in XListExtensions in ListExt.c in libX11 through 1.6.5. A malicious server can
    send a reply in which the first string overflows, causing a variable to be set to NULL that will be freed
    later on, leading to DoS (segmentation fault). (CVE-2018-14598)

  - An issue was discovered in libX11 through 1.6.5. The function XListExtensions in ListExt.c is vulnerable
    to an off-by-one error caused by malicious server responses, leading to DoS or possibly unspecified other
    impact. (CVE-2018-14599)

  - Endless recursion exists in xkbcomp/expr.c in xkbcommon and libxkbcommon before 0.8.1, which could be used
    by local attackers to crash xkbcommon users by supplying a crafted keymap file that triggers boolean
    negation. (CVE-2018-15853)

  - Unchecked NULL pointer usage in xkbcommon before 0.8.1 could be used by local attackers to crash (NULL
    pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser by supplying a crafted keymap file, because the XkbFile for an
    xkb_geometry section was mishandled. (CVE-2018-15855)

  - An issue was discovered in libX11 through 1.6.5. The function XListExtensions in ListExt.c interprets a
    variable as signed instead of unsigned, resulting in an out-of-bounds write (of up to 128 bytes), leading
    to DoS or remote code execution. (CVE-2018-14600)

  - Unchecked NULL pointer usage in xkbcommon before 0.8.1 could be used by local attackers to crash (NULL
    pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser by supplying a crafted keymap file, because geometry tokens were
    desupported incorrectly. (CVE-2018-15854)

  - An infinite loop when reaching EOL unexpectedly in compose/parser.c (aka the keymap parser) in xkbcommon
    before 0.8.1 could be used by local attackers to cause a denial of service during parsing of crafted

  - Unchecked NULL pointer usage when parsing invalid atoms in ExprResolveLhs in xkbcomp/expr.c in xkbcommon
    before 0.8.2 could be used by local attackers to crash (NULL pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser by
    supplying a crafted keymap file, because lookup failures are mishandled. (CVE-2018-15859)

  - Unchecked NULL pointer usage in ResolveStateAndPredicate in xkbcomp/compat.c in xkbcommon before 0.8.2
    could be used by local attackers to crash (NULL pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser by supplying a
    crafted keymap file with a no-op modmask expression. (CVE-2018-15863)

  - An invalid free in ExprAppendMultiKeysymList in xkbcomp/ast-build.c in xkbcommon before 0.8.1 could be
    used by local attackers to crash xkbcommon keymap parsers or possibly have unspecified other impact by
    supplying a crafted keymap file. (CVE-2018-15857)

  - Unchecked NULL pointer usage in ExprResolveLhs in xkbcomp/expr.c in xkbcommon before 0.8.2 could be used
    by local attackers to crash (NULL pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser by supplying a crafted keymap
    file that triggers an xkb_intern_atom failure. (CVE-2018-15861)

  - Unchecked NULL pointer usage in LookupModMask in xkbcomp/expr.c in xkbcommon before 0.8.2 could be used by
    local attackers to crash (NULL pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser by supplying a crafted keymap
    file with invalid virtual modifiers. (CVE-2018-15862)

  - Unchecked NULL pointer usage in resolve_keysym in xkbcomp/parser.y in xkbcommon before 0.8.2 could be used

    Although eu-size is intended to support ar files inside ar files, handle_ar in size.c closes the outer ar
    file before handling all inner entries. The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service
    (application crash) with a crafted ELF file. (CVE-2018-18520)

  - In elfutils 0.175, a heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in the function elf32_xlatetom in
    elf32_xlatetom.c in libelf. A crafted ELF input can cause a segmentation fault leading to denial of
    service (program crash) because ebl_core_note does not reject malformed core file notes. (CVE-2019-7665)

  - An invalid memory address dereference was discovered in dwfl_segment_report_module.c in libdwfl in
    elfutils through v0.174. The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) with a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated by consider_notes. (CVE-2018-18310)

  - Divide-by-zero vulnerabilities in the function arlib_add_symbols() in arlib.c in elfutils 0.174 allow
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) with a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated
    by eu-ranlib, because a zero sh_entsize is mishandled. (CVE-2018-18521)

  - A heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in the function read_srclines in dwarf_getsrclines.c in libdw
    in elfutils 0.175. A crafted input can cause segmentation faults, leading to denial-of-service, as
    demonstrated by eu-nm. (CVE-2019-7149)

  - An issue was discovered in elfutils 0.175. A segmentation fault can occur in the function elf64_xlatetom
    in libelf/elf32_xlatetom.c, due to dwfl_segment_report_module not checking whether the dyn data read from
    a core file is truncated. A crafted input can cause a program crash, leading to denial-of-service, as
    demonstrated by eu-stack. (CVE-2019-7150)

  - In elfutils 0.175, a negative-sized memcpy is attempted in elf_cvt_note in libelf/note_xlate.h because of
    an incorrect overflow check. Crafted elf input causes a segmentation fault, leading to denial of service
    (program crash). (CVE-2019-7664)

    (CVE-2020-8631)

  - The default cloud-init configuration, in cloud-init 0.6.2 and newer, included ssh_deletekeys: 0,
    disabling cloud-init's deletion of ssh host keys. In some environments, this could lead to instances
    created by cloning a golden master or template system, sharing ssh host keys, and being able to
    impersonate one another or conduct man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2018-10896)

  - In cloud-init through 19.4, rand_user_password in cloudinit/config/cc_set_passwords.py has a small default
    pwlen value, which makes it easier for attackers to guess passwords. (CVE-2020-8632)

as referenced in the 1.0.2zl advisory.

  - Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit values for the
    field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes. Impact summary: Out of bound memory
    writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all
    the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only named curves are
    supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary
    (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a
    vulnerable application is low. In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509
    certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates. Any
    problematic use-cases would have to be using an exotic curve encoding. The affected APIs include:
    EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.
    Applications working with exotic explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters, that make it possible to
    represent invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may
    terminate abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of array bounds. Remote code execution cannot
    easily be ruled out. The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

  - Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit values for the
    field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes. Impact summary: Out of bound memory
    writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all
    the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only named curves are
    supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary
    (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a
    vulnerable application is low. In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509
    certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates. Any
    problematic use-cases would have to be using an exotic curve encoding. The affected APIs include:
    EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.
    Applications working with exotic explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters, that make it possible to
    represent invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may
    terminate abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of array bounds. Remote code execution cannot
    easily be ruled out. The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
