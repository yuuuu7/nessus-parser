occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH

It is likely that this condition is caused by one or more of the
following:

1)  A plugin tried to access a resource that requires a special
    privilege level such as NT_AUTHORITY on Windows.  The resource
    may have had its permissions altered since the plugin was
    written.
2)  Environmental issues may have caused an intermittent failure
    in authentication that caused Nessus to stop attempting
    privilege escalation.
3)  A resource on the host that Nessus attempts to access multiple
    times may be configured with access limits.  Related lockouts may
    look like permissions failures.
4)  Nessus may have tried to access a resource that does not exist
    on a target that fails to properly report permissions issues.
    For instance, on some legacy unix systems such as AIX or HP-UX
    there is no way to distinguish a missing resource from a

  - Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache
    Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers
    correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led to the use of an incorrect
    infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed. This issue
    affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1

successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","

It is likely that this condition is caused by one or more of the
following:

1)  A plugin tried to access a resource that requires a special
    privilege level such as NT_AUTHORITY on Windows.  The resource
    may have had its permissions altered since the plugin was
    written.
2)  Environmental issues may have caused an intermittent failure
    in authentication that caused Nessus to stop attempting
    privilege escalation.
3)  A resource on the host that Nessus attempts to access multiple
    times may be configured with access limits.  Related lockouts may
    look like permissions failures.
4)  Nessus may have tried to access a resource that does not exist
    on a target that fails to properly report permissions issues.
    For instance, on some legacy unix systems such as AIX or HP-UX
    there is no way to distinguish a missing resource from a
    permissions error.

wrong resource or a resource that has recently received special OS
