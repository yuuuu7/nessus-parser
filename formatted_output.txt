Description:
The remote Windows host is missing security update 5044277. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities

  - libcurl's ASN1 parser has this utf8asn1str() function used for parsing an ASN.1 UTF-8 string. Itcan detect
    an invalid field and return error. Unfortunately, when doing so it also invokes `free()` on a 4 byte
    localstack buffer. Most modern malloc implementations detect this error and immediately abort. Some
    however accept the input pointer and add that memory to its list of available chunks. This leads to the
    overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the `free()`
    implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags. The most likely outcome of exploting this
    flaw is a crash, although it cannot be ruled out that more serious results can be had in special
    circumstances. (CVE-2024-6197)
  
  - Remote Desktop Client Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2024-43599)

  - An unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted protocol message to a Routing and Remote 
    Access Service (RRAS) server, which could lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the RAS server machine.

Description:
The remote Windows host is missing an update to the Secure Boot DBX. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities:

  - A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod implementation allows
    the unloading of a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent
    module is still loaded leading to a use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary
    code to be executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
    (CVE-2020-25632)

  - A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Setparam_prefix() in the menu
    rendering code performs a length calculation on the assumption that expressing a quoted
    single quote will require 3 characters, while it actually requires 4 characters which
    allows an attacker to corrupt memory by one byte for each quote in the input. The
    highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as
    well as system availability. (CVE-2021-20233)


Additionally, the host is affected by several other security feature bypasses in Secure Boot.

Note: Tenable is testing for the presence of the expected signatures added in the DBX update published on March 2, 2021

    custom HaProxyMessageDecoder. (CVE-2022-41881)



  - Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network application framework. Starting in version

    4.1.83.Final and prior to 4.1.86.Final, when calling `DefaultHttpHeadesr.set` with an _iterator_ of

    values, header value validation was not performed, allowing malicious header values in the iterator to

    perform HTTP Response Splitting. This issue has been patched in version 4.1.86.Final. Integrators can work

    around the issue by changing the `DefaultHttpHeaders.set(CharSequence, Iterator<?>)` call, into a

    `remove()` call, and call `add()` in a loop over the iterator of values. (CVE-2022-41915)



  - A defect was discovered in the Python ssl module where there is a memory race condition with the

    ssl.SSLContext methods cert_store_stats() and get_ca_certs(). The race condition can be triggered if

    the methods are called at the same time as certificates are loaded into the SSLContext, such as during the

    TLS handshake with a certificate directory configured. This issue is fixed in CPython 3.10.14, 3.11.9,

    3.12.3, and 3.13.0a5. (CVE-2024-0397)

have Full Control permission to any directories that contain service
executables.
CVE: 
Description:
At least one Windows service executable with insecure permissions was
detected on the remote host. Services configured to use an executable
with weak permissions are vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks.
An unprivileged user could modify or overwrite the executable with
arbitrary code, which would be executed the next time the service is
started. Depending on the user that the service runs as, this could
result in privilege escalation.

This plugin checks if any of the following groups have permissions to
modify executable files that are started by Windows services :

  - Everyone
    - Users
    - Domain Users
    - Authenticated Users

Name: SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted, SSL Certificate with Wrong Hostname, SSL Self-Signed Certificate
Plugin Output: -
Solution: Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.
CVE: 
Description:
The 'commonName' (CN) attribute of the SSL certificate presented for
this service is for a different machine.
The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a

recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host

in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish

a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host. 



Note that this plugin does not check for certificate chains that end

in a certificate that is not self-signed, but is signed by an

unrecognized certificate authority.

Note that this plugin does not check for certificate chains that end
in a certificate that is not self-signed, but is signed by an
unrecognized certificate authority.
The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be

broken, as stated below :



  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    server might not be descended from a known public

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the

    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed

    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are

    missing that would connect the top of the certificate

    chain to a known public certificate authority.



  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate

    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the

    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the

    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.



  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature

    that either didn't match the certificate's information

    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by

    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be

    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be

    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer

    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not

    support or does not recognize.



If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the

chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 

identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 

man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.

CVE: CVE-2016-2183
Description:
The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that offer medium
strength encryption. Nessus regards medium strength as any encryption
that uses key lengths at least 64 bits and less than 112 bits, or 
else that uses the 3DES encryption suite.

Note that it is considerably easier to circumvent medium strength
encryption if the attacker is on the same physical network.
Affected Hosts: 10.46.254.48/3389

Name: SSL RC4 Cipher Suites Supported (Bar Mitzvah)
Plugin Output: -
Solution: Reconfigure the affected application, if possible, to avoid use of RC4
ciphers. Consider using TLS 1.2 with AES-GCM suites subject to browser
and web server support.
CVE: CVE-2013-2566, CVE-2015-2808
Description:
The remote host supports the use of RC4 in one or more cipher suites.
The RC4 cipher is flawed in its generation of a pseudo-random stream
of bytes so that a wide variety of small biases are introduced into
the stream, decreasing its randomness.

If plaintext is repeatedly encrypted (e.g., HTTP cookies), and an

  - Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0 and 11.3.0: Denial of Service with large

    HTTP headers: By using a combination of many requests with maximum sized headers (almost 80 KB per

    connection), and carefully timed completion of the headers, it is possible to cause the HTTP server to

    abort from heap allocation failure. Attack potential is mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other

    proxy layer. (CVE-2018-12121)



  - The HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js ignores spaces in the `Content-Length` header, allowing

    input such as `Content-Length: 1 2` to be interpreted as having a value of `12`. The HTTP specification

    does not allow for spaces in the `Content-Length` value and the Node.js HTTP parser has been brought into

    line on this particular difference. The security risk of this flaw to Node.js users is considered to be

    VERY LOW as it is difficult, and may be impossible, to craft an attack that makes use of this flaw in a

    way that could not already be achieved by supplying an incorrect value for `Content-Length`.

    Vulnerabilities may exist in user-code that make incorrect assumptions about the potential accuracy of

    this value compared to the actual length of the data supplied. Node.js users crafting lower-level HTTP

    utilities are advised to re-check the length of any input supplied after parsing is complete.

ELSA-2021-3296 advisory.



  - LookupCol.c in X.Org X through X11R7.7 and libX11 before 1.7.1 might allow remote attackers to execute

    arbitrary code. The libX11 XLookupColor request (intended for server-side color lookup) contains a flaw

    allowing a client to send color-name requests with a name longer than the maximum size allowed by the

    protocol (and also longer than the maximum packet size for normal-sized packets). The user-controlled data

    exceeding the maximum size is then interpreted by the server as additional X protocol requests and

    executed, e.g., to disable X server authorization completely. For example, if the victim encounters

    malicious terminal control sequences for color codes, then the attacker may be able to take full control

    of the running graphical session. (CVE-2021-31535)

Plugin Output: -
Solution: Update the affected libssh2, libssh2-devel and / or libssh2-docs packages.
CVE: CVE-2019-17498
Description:
The remote Oracle Linux 7 host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the

ELSA-2020-3915 advisory.



  - In libssh2 v1.9.0 and earlier versions, the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c has an integer overflow

    in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent

    memory read. A crafted SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of

    service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server. (CVE-2019-17498)



Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version

number.

Description:
The remote Oracle Linux 7 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the

ELSA-2020-4005 advisory.



  - libxslt through 1.1.33 allows bypass of a protection mechanism because callers of xsltCheckRead and

    xsltCheckWrite permit access even upon receiving a -1 error code. xsltCheckRead can return -1 for a

    crafted URL that is not actually invalid and is subsequently loaded. (CVE-2019-11068)



  - In xsltCopyText in transform.c in libxslt 1.1.33, a pointer variable isn't reset under certain

    circumstances. If the relevant memory area happened to be freed and reused in a certain way, a bounds

    check could fail and memory outside a buffer could be written to, or uninitialized data could be

    disclosed. (CVE-2019-18197)

  - A flaw was found in Nettle in versions before 3.7.2, where several Nettle signature verification functions

    (GOST DSA, EDDSA & ECDSA) result in the Elliptic Curve Cryptography point (ECC) multiply function being

    called with out-of-range scalers, possibly resulting in incorrect results. This flaw allows an attacker to

    force an invalid signature, causing an assertion failure or possible validation. The highest threat to

    this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-20305)

Description:
The remote Oracle Linux 6 / 7 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in

the ELSA-2021-9395 advisory.



  - net/bluetooth/hci_request.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.2 has a race condition for removal of the HCI

    controller. (CVE-2021-32399)



  - fs/seq_file.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.13.x before 5.13.4 does not properly restrict seq buffer

    allocations, leading to an integer overflow, an Out-of-bounds Write, and escalation to root by an

    unprivileged user, aka CID-8cae8cd89f05. (CVE-2021-33909)



  - A memory disclosure flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ethernet drivers, in the way it read data from

    the EEPROM of the device. This flaw allows a local user to read uninitialized values from the kernel

    memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality. (CVE-2020-14304)



  - A heap out-of-bounds write affecting Linux since v2.6.19-rc1 was discovered in net/netfilter/x_tables.c.

    This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name

    space (CVE-2021-22555)



Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version

number.
The remote Oracle Linux 6 / 7 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in

the ELSA-2023-12375 advisory.



  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in iscsi_sw_tcp_session_create in drivers/scsi/iscsi_tcp.c in

    SCSI sub-component in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw an attacker could leak kernel internal information.

    (CVE-2023-2162)



  - cbq_classify in net/sched/sch_cbq.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial

    of service (slab-out-of-bounds read) because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes

    indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results). (CVE-2023-23454)



  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A denial of service flaw may occur if there is a consecutive request

    of the NVME_IOCTL_RESET and the NVME_IOCTL_SUBSYS_RESET through the device file of the driver, resulting

    in a PCIe link disconnect. (CVE-2022-3169)



  - A speculative pointer dereference problem exists in the Linux Kernel on the do_prlimit() function. The

    resource argument value is controlled and is used in pointer arithmetic for the 'rlim' variable and can be

    used to leak the contents. We recommend upgrading past version 6.1.8 or commit

    739790605705ddcf18f21782b9c99ad7d53a8c11 (CVE-2023-0458)



  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the az6027 driver in drivers/media/usb/dev-usb/az6027.c in

    the Linux Kernel. The message from user space is not checked properly before transferring into the device.

    This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or potentially cause a denial of service.

    (CVE-2023-28328)



  - A flaw use after free in the Linux kernel Xircom 16-bit PCMCIA (PC-card) Ethernet driver was found.A local

    user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

    (CVE-2023-1670)



  - ** REJECT ** This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority because it was the

    duplicate of CVE-2023-31436. (CVE-2023-2248)



Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version

number.
The remote Oracle Linux 6 / 7 host has packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in

the ELSA-2024-12700 advisory.

  - avahi-daemon in Avahi through 0.6.32 and 0.7 inadvertently responds to IPv6 unicast queries with source

    addresses that are not on-link, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic

    amplification) and may cause information leakage by obtaining potentially sensitive information from the

    responding device via port-5353 UDP packets. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2015-2809. (CVE-2017-6519)

  - dbus before 1.10.28, 1.12.x before 1.12.16, and 1.13.x before 1.13.12, as used in DBusServer in Canonical

    Upstart in Ubuntu 14.04 (and in some, less common, uses of dbus-daemon), allows cookie spoofing because of

    symlink mishandling in the reference implementation of DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 in the libdbus library. (This only

    affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism.) A malicious client with write access to its own

    home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to

    read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case, this could result in the DBusServer reusing a

    cookie that is known to the malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent

    client connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication bypass. (CVE-2019-12749)

  - An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.6 and 2.67.x before 2.67.3. The function g_bytes_new has

    an integer overflow on 64-bit platforms due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow

    could potentially lead to memory corruption. (CVE-2021-27219)

  - In ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16, ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.2 (Other branches of ISC DHCP (i.e., releases

    in the 4.0.x series or lower and releases in the 4.3.x series) are beyond their End-of-Life (EOL) and no

    longer supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from

    those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering

    the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected

    (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler

    flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced

    the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when

    reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to

    the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd

    server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to

    the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in

    lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in

    the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit

    architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not

    occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be

    improperly deleted. (CVE-2021-25217)

    watchOS before 3, and other products) does not forbid namespace nodes in XPointer ranges, which allows

    remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and memory

    corruption) via a crafted XML document. (CVE-2016-4658)

    privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected. Helper programs for

    AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with privileges associated with group

    memberships of the sshd process, if the configuration specifies running the command as a different user.

    modified, to cause RPM database corruption and execute code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is

    to data integrity, confidentiality, and system availability. (CVE-2021-20271)

  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap

    buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other

    malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But

    there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.

    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the

    octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence

    of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote

    exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing

    modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,

    `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to

    directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module

    `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present

    on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be

    specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important

    modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)

  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.

    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME

    incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently

    interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL

    checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may

    allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or

    enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate

    chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these

    inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is

    uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented

    their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. (CVE-2023-0286)

    longer supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from
    those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering
    the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected
    (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler
    flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced
    the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when
    reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to
    the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd
    server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to
    the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in
    lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in
    the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit

    occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be

    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME
    incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently
    interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL
    checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may
    allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
    enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate
    chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these
    inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is
    uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented
    their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. (CVE-2023-0286)

  - A heap out-of-bounds write may heppen during the handling of Huffman tables in the PNG reader. This may

    lead to data corruption in the heap space. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availablity impact may be

    considered Low as it's very complex to an attacker control the encoding and positioning of corrupted

    Huffman entries to achieve results such as arbitrary code execution and/or secure boot circumvention. This

    flaw affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3696)



  - A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write in the heap area. An attacker may

    take advantage of that to cause heap data corruption or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent

    secure boot protections. This issue has a high complexity to be exploited as an attacker needs to perform

    some triage over the heap layout to achieve signifcant results, also the values written into the memory

    are repeated three times in a row making difficult to produce valid payloads. This flaw affects grub2

    versions prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3695)



  - A crafted JPEG image may lead the JPEG reader to underflow its data pointer, allowing user-controlled data

    to be written in heap. To a successful to be performed the attacker needs to perform some triage over the

    heap layout and craft an image with a malicious format and payload. This vulnerability can lead to data

    corruption and eventual code execution or secure boot circumvention. This flaw affects grub2 versions

    prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3697)



  - Integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets; A malicious crafted IP packet can lead to an integer

    underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets() function on rsm->total_len value. Under certain circumstances the

    total_len value may end up wrapping around to a small integer number which will be used in memory

    allocation. If the attack succeeds in such way, subsequent operations can write past the end of the

    buffer. (CVE-2022-28733)



  - Out-of-bounds write when handling split HTTP headers; When handling split HTTP headers, GRUB2 HTTP code

    accidentally moves its internal data buffer point by one position. This can lead to a out-of-bound write

    further when parsing the HTTP request, writing a NULL byte past the buffer. It's conceivable that an

    attacker controlled set of packets can lead to corruption of the GRUB2's internal memory metadata.

  - A heap out-of-bounds write may heppen during the handling of Huffman tables in the PNG reader. This may
    lead to data corruption in the heap space. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availablity impact may be
    considered Low as it's very complex to an attacker control the encoding and positioning of corrupted
    Huffman entries to achieve results such as arbitrary code execution and/or secure boot circumvention. This
    flaw affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3696)

  - A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write in the heap area. An attacker may
    take advantage of that to cause heap data corruption or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent
    secure boot protections. This issue has a high complexity to be exploited as an attacker needs to perform
    some triage over the heap layout to achieve signifcant results, also the values written into the memory
    are repeated three times in a row making difficult to produce valid payloads. This flaw affects grub2
    versions prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3695)

  - A crafted JPEG image may lead the JPEG reader to underflow its data pointer, allowing user-controlled data
    to be written in heap. To a successful to be performed the attacker needs to perform some triage over the
    heap layout and craft an image with a malicious format and payload. This vulnerability can lead to data
    corruption and eventual code execution or secure boot circumvention. This flaw affects grub2 versions
    prior grub-2.12. (CVE-2021-3697)

  - Integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets; A malicious crafted IP packet can lead to an integer
    underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets() function on rsm->total_len value. Under certain circumstances the
    total_len value may end up wrapping around to a small integer number which will be used in memory
    allocation. If the attack succeeds in such way, subsequent operations can write past the end of the
    buffer. (CVE-2022-28733)

  - Out-of-bounds write when handling split HTTP headers; When handling split HTTP headers, GRUB2 HTTP code
    accidentally moves its internal data buffer point by one position. This can lead to a out-of-bound write
    further when parsing the HTTP request, writing a NULL byte past the buffer. It's conceivable that an
    attacker controlled set of packets can lead to corruption of the GRUB2's internal memory metadata.

Name: Curl Use-After-Free < 7.87 (CVE-2022-43552)
Plugin Output: -
Solution: Upgrade Curl to version 7.87.0 or later
CVE: CVE-2022-43552
Description:
The version of Curl installed on the remote host is prior to 7.87.0. It is therefore affected by a use-after-free
vulnerability. Curl can be asked to tunnel virtually all protocols it supports through an HTTP proxy. HTTP
proxies can (and often do) deny such tunnel operations. When getting denied to tunnel the specific protocols
SMB or TELNET, curl would use a heap-allocated struct after it had been freed, in its transfer shutdown code
path.

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.
Affected Hosts: 10.46.254.196/445, 10.46.254.197/445, 10.46.254.199/445, 10.46.254.201/445

Name: libcurl 7.32.0 < 8.9.1 DoS (CVE-2024-7264)
Plugin Output: -
Solution: Upgrade Curl to version 8.9.1 or later
CVE: CVE-2024-7264
Description:
The version of libcurl installed on the remote host is between 7.32.0 and prior to 8.9.1. It is, therefore, affected by a

denial of service (DoS) vulnerability. libcurl's ASN1 parser code has the GTime2str() function, used for parsing an 

ASN.1 Generalized Time field. If given an syntactically incorrect field, the parser might end up using -1 for the length

of the time fraction, leading to a strlen() getting performed on a pointer to a heap buffer area that is not (purposely)

null terminated. This flaw most likely leads to a crash, but can also lead to heap contents getting returned to the

application when CURLINFO_CERTINFO is used.

CVE: CVE-2023-31102, CVE-2023-40481
Description:
The version of 7-Zip installed on the remote Windows host is below 23.00. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities:

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in 7-zip due to an integer underflow. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this, by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted archive, to execute
    arbitrary code on the system. (CVE-2023-31102)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in 7-zip due to an out-of-bounds write. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this, by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted archive, to execute
    arbitrary code on the system. (CVE-2023-40481)

CVE: CVE-2021-44832
Description:
The version of Apache Log4j on the remote host is 2.0 < 2.3.2, 2.4 < 2.12.4, or 2.13 < 2.17.1. It is, therefore,

affected by a remote code execution vulnerability. Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security

fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack where an attacker with permission

to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data

source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute remote code. This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to

the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.

CVE: CVE-2021-45105
Description:
The version of Apache Log4j on the remote host is 2.x < 2.3.1 / 2.13.2 / 2.17.0. It is, therefore, affected by 

a denial of service vulnerability. Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled 

recursion from self-referential lookups. When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a 

Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can 

craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a StackOverflowError that will terminate 

the process.

Solution: Upgrade to OpenSSH version 9.6 or later.
CVE: CVE-2023-48795, CVE-2023-51384, CVE-2023-51385
Description:
The version of OpenSSH installed on the remote host is prior to 9.6. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the
    assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)

CVE: CVE-2024-9143
Description:
The version of OpenSSL installed on the remote host is prior to 1.0.2zl. It is, therefore, affected by a vulnerability

as referenced in the 1.0.2zl advisory.



  - Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit values for the

    field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes. Impact summary: Out of bound memory

    writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all

    the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only named curves are

    supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary

    (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a

    vulnerable application is low. In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509

    certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates. Any

    problematic use-cases would have to be using an exotic curve encoding. The affected APIs include:

    EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.

    Applications working with exotic explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters, that make it possible to

    represent invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may

    terminate abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of array bounds. Remote code execution cannot

    easily be ruled out. The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Description:
The version of VMware vCenter Server installed on the remote host is 7.x prior to 7.0 U3s or 8.x prior to 8.0 U3b. It
is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the VMSA-2024-0019 advisory:

  - The vCenter Server contains a heap-overflow vulnerability in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. A
    malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server may trigger this vulnerability by sending a
    specially crafted network packet potentially leading to remote code execution. (CVE-2024-38812)

  - The vCenter Server contains a privilege escalation vulnerability. A malicious actor with network access to
    vCenter Server may trigger this vulnerability to escalate privileges to root by sending a specially
    crafted network packet. (CVE-2024-38813)

====================

Name: WinSCP < 6.3.3 Key Recovery Attack Vulnerability
Plugin Output: -
Solution: Upgrade to WinSCP version 6.3.3 or later.
CVE: CVE-2024-31497
Description:
The version of WinSCP installed on the remote Windows host is prior to 6.3.3. It is, therefore, affected by a key 
recovery attack vulnerability. In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker 
to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially 
important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. The required set of 
signed messages may be publicly readable because they are stored in a public Git service that supports use of SSH for 
commit signing, and the signatures were made by Pageant through an agent-forwarding mechanism. In other words, an 
adversary may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's private key, even if there is no 
further use of vulnerable PuTTY versions. After a key compromise, an adversary may be able to conduct supply-chain 
attacks on software maintained in Git. A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH 
server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted 
by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other 
entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can 
derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the other services 
include Git services, then again it may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. 
This also affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3, TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and 
TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.
